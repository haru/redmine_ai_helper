## Project Health Report

You can generate a project health report using the AI Helper Plugin. This feature provides a comprehensive overview of the project's status, including metrics such as open issues, closed issues, and overall project health.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f01c6ef-6cee-4e79-b693-c17081566c78)

Health reports can be exported to Markdown and PDF formats.

### Health Report History

Health reports are automatically saved and can be reviewed later. You can:
- View past health reports to track project progress over time
- Compare multiple health reports to analyze trends and changes in project health
- Export comparison results to Markdown and PDF formats

This historical tracking helps you understand how your project's health evolves and identify patterns or issues early.

# üì¶ Installation

1. Extract the plugin to your Redmine plugins folder:
   ```bash
   cd {REDMINE_ROOT}/plugins/
   git clone https://github.com/haru/redmine_ai_helper.git
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
   ```

4. Restart Redmine:


# ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Configuration

## Plugin Settings

1. Open the AI Helper settings page from the Administration menu.
2. Create a model profile and fill in the following fields:
   - Type: Choose the AI model type (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic. Strongly recommend using OpenAI or Anthropic)
   - Name: Enter a name for the model profile
   - Access Key: Enter the API key for the AI service
   - Model name: Specify the AI model name (e.g., gpt-4.1-mini)
   - Temperature: Set the temperature for the AI model (e.g., 0.7)
3. Select the model profile you created from the dropdown menu and save the settings.


## Role and Permission Settings

1. Go to "Roles and permissions" in the administration menu
2. Configure the AI Helper permissions for each role as needed

## Project-specific Settings

1. Open the settings page for each project where you want to use the plugin
2. Go to the "Modules" tab
3. Enable "AI Helper" by checking the box
4. Click "Save" to apply the changes

# ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

## MCP Server Settings

The "Model Context Protocol (MCP)" is an open standard protocol proposed by Anthropic that allows AI models to interact with external systems such as files, databases, tools, and APIs.
Reference: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers

The AI Helper Plugin can use the MCP Server to perform tasks, such as sending issue summaries to Slack.

1. Create `config/ai_helper/config.json` under the root directory of Redmine.
2. Configure the MCP server as follows (example for Slack, GitHub, and Context7):
   ```json
   {
      "mcpServers": {
         "slack": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
               "-y",
               "@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack"
            ],
            "env": {
               "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "xoxb-your-bot-token",
               "SLACK_TEAM_ID": "T01234567"
            }
         },
         "github": {
            "type": "http",
            "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
            "headers": {
               "Authorization": "Bearer github_pat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
            }
         },
         "context7": {
            "type": "sse",
            "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/sse"
         }
      }
   }
   ```
3. Restart Redmine.

## Vector Search Settings

Configure settings to perform vector searches for issues using Qdrant.
With this configuration, the AI Helper Plugin can use Qdrant to perform vector searches on Redmine issues and wiki data.

**Note:** Vector search functionality is not available when using Anthropic AI models. Please use OpenAI or other supported AI providers for vector search features.

### Qdrant Setup

Here is an example configuration using Docker Compose.

```yaml:docker-compose.yml
services:
   qdrant:
      image: qdrant/qdrant
      ports:
         - 6333:6333
      volumes:
         - ./storage:/qdrant/storage
```

### Creating the Index

Run the following command to create the index.

```bash
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:ai_helper:vector:generate RAILS_ENV=production
```

Registers ticket data into the index. The initial run may take some time.

```bash
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:ai_helper:vector:regist RAILS_ENV=production
```

Please execute the above commands periodically using cron or a similar tool to reflect ticket updates.

This completes the configuration.

### Recreating the Index

If you change the embedding model, delete the index and recreate it using the following commands.

```bash
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:ai_helper:vector:destroy RAILS_ENV=production
```

# üõ†Ô∏è Build your own Agent

The AI Helper plugin adopts a multi-agent model. You can create your own agent and integrate it into the AI Helper plugin.

To create your own agent, you need to create the following two files:

- **Agent Implementation**
   - A class that inherits from `RedmineAiHelper::BaseAgent`
   - Defines the agent's behavior
- **Tools**
   - A class that inherits from `RedmineAiHelper::BaseTools`
   - Implements the tools used by the agent

Place these files in any location within Redmine and load them.

As an example, there is a plugin called `redmine_fortune` under the `example` directory. Place this plugin in the `plugins` folder of Redmine. This will add a fortune-telling feature to the AI Helper plugin. When you ask, "Tell me my fortune for today," it will return a fortune-telling result.

# ü™Ñ Langfuse integration
By integrating with Langfuse, you can track the usage of the AI Helper Plugin. This allows you to monitor the cost of LLM queries and improve prompts effectively.


![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35904911-db39-4da7-baf6-a90fe05d9115)

To configure the integration, add the following to `{REDMINE_ROOT}/config/ai_helper/config.yml`:

```yaml
langfuse:
  public_key: "pk-lf-************"
  secret_key: "sk-lf-************"
  endpoint: https://us.cloud.langfuse.com # Change this to match your environment
```

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

Please note that AI responses may not always be 100% accurate. Users should verify and validate AI-provided information at their own discretion.


# ü§ù Contributing

I welcome bug reports and feature improvement suggestions through GitHub Issues. Pull requests are also appreciated.

‚ö†Ô∏è When creating a pull request, always branch off from the `develop` branch.
This project follows the [A successful Git branching model (git flow)](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) where the `develop` branch serves as the integration branch for new features and the `main` branch contains production-ready releases.

Please make sure that all tests pass before pushing.

## How to Run Tests

### Preparation

Create a test database.

```bash
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
```

Create a test Git repository.

```bash
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:ai_helper:setup_scm
```

### Running the Tests

```bash
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:test NAME=redmine_ai_helper
```
