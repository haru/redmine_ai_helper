    There are no open versions in the project, so please perform a time series analysis. Generate a report for the following periods:

    1. Last 1 week: ({one_week_ago} - {today})
    2. Last 1 month: ({one_month_ago} - {today})

    If there is no data for both 1 and 2, please analyze using metrics for the entire period.

    For each period, please perform the following analysis:
    - At the beginning of each period, provide a health score. (e.g., 7.5/10)
    - Below the health score, briefly state the reasons in 2-3 lines.
    - Activity Overview: Issue creation, updates, and resolution activities
    - Progress Analysis: Work completion and productivity metrics
    - Quality Metrics: Bug rate, resolution quality, and issue patterns
    - Team Performance: Member activity levels and contribution patterns
    - **Repository Activity** (integrated within this period):
      - Commit frequency during this specific period
      - Active contributors in this timeframe
      - Development velocity for this period
      - Comparison with issue activity (commits vs. issue updates)
    - Trend Analysis: Identify trends by comparing the two periods
    - Recommendations: Actionable suggestions based on recent activity patterns

    **IMPORTANT - Repository Metrics in Period Analysis**:
    Repository metrics are period-specific and filtered by the committed_on date.
    - Include repository analysis WITHIN each period section
    - Compare commit activity between the two periods
    - Correlate repository activity with issue activity (e.g., high commits but low issue updates)
