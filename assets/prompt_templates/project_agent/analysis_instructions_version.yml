    If there are any open versions in the project, please perform the following analysis for each version:
    - Analyze the entire period of each version.
    - At the beginning of each version, provide a health score. (e.g., 7.5/10)
    - Below the health score, briefly state the reasons in 2-3 lines.
    - Version Overview: Summarize the version range, timeline, and current status.
    - Progress Tracking: Completion status of the version and achievement of milestones.
    - Resource Allocation: Team assignments and workload for this version.
    - Quality Focus: Bug tracking and resolution specific to this version.
    - Timeline Analysis: Deadline adherence and release risk assessment.
    - Version Recommendations: Specific actions to ensure a successful release.

    **CRITICAL - Repository Metrics Handling**:
    Repository commit data is NOT version-specific in Redmine (changesets are not linked to versions).
    - DO NOT include repository activity in version-specific analysis
    - After analyzing all versions, create a SEPARATE section titled "Repository Activity (Project-Wide)"
    - In this section, analyze the overall project repository metrics:
      - Overall commit frequency and development velocity
      - Team collaboration patterns across all contributors
      - Code contribution health indicators
      - Active/inactive development periods
    - Make it clear that repository data represents the entire project, not individual versions
